# Milan admin, made by Thuxmwarn.
The most advanced roblox (*Fe*) admin.

never got myself to write plugin support because it was meant to be private admin and stuff...
The point of releasing this is because I don't exploit that much and I felt like somebody might like this skeleton for their projects.

## If you wanna work on it (for personal use, or to contribute):
> Fix console with multiple exploits support, (enable _debug for console debug)

> Rewrite UI because its just horrid.

> And maybe rewrite some logic which is stupid.

## Filesystem doesn't work with celery nor Fluxus, haven't tried any others (at the time of posting, only microsoft client works)

Thanks for contribution of inputhandeler from Articlize (*if you know, you know*)
